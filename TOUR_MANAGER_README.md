## Data Source & Score Updates

The rider data is automatically loaded from the CSV files in the `TdF 2025 team selector/` directory:
- `Sheet1-Tabell 1.csv` - Main rider data with names, teams, prices, and confirmation status
- `Point scheme-Tabell 1.csv` - Official scoring system
- `scoring-updates.csv` - Live scoring updates during the race (optional)

### Updating Scores During the Race

1. Create a file called `scoring-updates.csv` in the `TdF 2025 team selector/` folder
2. Format each line as: `Rider Name;Stage Points;GC Points;Leader Bonus`
3. Example content:
   ```
   POGACAR Tadej;80;600;20
   VINGEGAARD HANSEN Jonas;50;450;0
   PHILIPSEN Jasper;35;0;0
   ```
4. Users click "Refresh Rider Data" in the Settings tab to load updates
5. All team scores are automatically recalculated

### Team Sharing

- Click "Share Team" to generate a URL that others can use to view your team
- Perfect for comparing teams with friends on GitHub Pages
- Shared teams are automatically imported when someone visits your shared URL

## Data Management

### Local Storage
- Teams are automatically saved to browser's local storage
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Each manager's team is stored separately

### Export/Import
- **Export**: Download all team data as JSON file
- **Import**: Upload previously exported data
- Useful for backup or sharing between devices

### Reset
- "Reset All Data" removes all teams and settings
- Use with caution - this action cannot be undone

## Troubleshooting

### Rider Loading Issues
- **"No riders loaded"**: Make sure you're running a local web server (see Quick Start)
- **"CSV not found"**: Ensure the `TdF 2025 team selector/` folder is in the same directory as `tourmanager.html`
- **Browser directly opening file**: Use `http://localhost:8000` instead of `file://` URLs

### Team Selection Issues
- **"Too Expensive"**: Rider price would exceed 4000 point budget
- **"Team Full"**: Already have 8 riders selected
- **Button disabled**: Check budget and team size constraints

### Performance Issues
- Large rider lists may load slowly on older devices
- Clear browser cache if experiencing display issues

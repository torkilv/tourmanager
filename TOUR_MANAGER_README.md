## Data Source & Score Updates

The rider data is automatically loaded from the CSV files in the `TdF 2025 team selector/` directory:
- `Sheet1-Tabell 1.csv` - Main rider data with names, teams, prices, and confirmation status
- `Point scheme-Tabell 1.csv` - Official scoring system
- `scoring-updates.csv` - Live scoring updates during the race (optional)

### Updating Scores During the Race

1. Create a file called `scoring-updates.csv` in the `TdF 2025 team selector/` folder
2. Format each line as: `Rider Name;Stage Points;GC Points;Leader Bonus`
3. Example content:
   ```
   POGACAR Tadej;80;600;20
   VINGEGAARD HANSEN Jonas;50;450;0
   PHILIPSEN Jasper;35;0;0
   ```
4. Users click "Refresh Rider Data" in the Settings tab to load updates
5. All team scores are automatically recalculated

### Team Sharing

- Click "Share Team" to generate a URL that others can use to view your team
- Perfect for comparing teams with friends on GitHub Pages
- Shared teams are automatically imported when someone visits your shared URL

## Data Management

### Automatic Cloud Sync üåü
**Tour Manager automatically saves all data to a shared Firebase database:**
- **Real-time sync**: Teams saved instantly when you add/remove riders
- **Live updates**: See other players' changes appear automatically
- **Cross-device access**: Same data on phone, laptop, tablet, any browser
- **Automatic backup**: Data safely stored in Google's cloud infrastructure

### Status Check
- **Settings Tab**: Shows current database connection status
- **Connected**: ‚úÖ "Connected to shared database - live multiplayer active"
- **Fallback**: ‚ö†Ô∏è "Firebase not configured - using local storage"

### Export/Import (Backup)
- **Export**: Download all team data as JSON file
- **Import**: Upload previously exported data
- Useful for manual backups or data migration

### Local Storage Fallback
If Firebase connection fails:
- Teams saved to browser's local storage only
- Data persists between browser sessions
- No sync between devices/players - each browser independent

## Troubleshooting

### Rider Loading Issues
- **"No riders loaded"**: Make sure you're running a local web server (see Quick Start)
- **"CSV not found"**: Ensure the `TdF 2025 team selector/` folder is in the same directory as `tourmanager.html`
- **Browser directly opening file**: Use `http://localhost:8000` instead of `file://` URLs

### Team Selection Issues
- **"Too Expensive"**: Rider price would exceed 4000 point budget
- **"Team Full"**: Already have 8 riders selected
- **Button disabled**: Check budget and team size constraints

### Performance Issues
- Large rider lists may load slowly on older devices
- Clear browser cache if experiencing display issues
